    "**Read all the instructions below carefully before you start working on the assignment.**\n",
    "- The purpose of this course is that you learn RL and the best way to do that is by implementation and experimentation.\n",
    "- The assignment requires your to implement some algorithms and you are required report your findings after experimenting with those algorithms.\n",
    "- **You are required to submit ZIP file containing a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), and an image folder. The notebook would include the code, graphs/plots of the experiments you run and your findings/observations. Image folder is the folder having plots, images, etc.**\n",
    "- In case you use any maths in your explanations, render it using latex in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- You are expected to implement algorithms on your own and not copy it from other sources/class mates. Of course, you can refer to lecture slides.\n",
    "- If you use any reference or material (including code), please cite the source, else it will be considered plagiarism. But referring to other sources that directly solve the problems given in the assignment is not allowed. There is a limit to which you can refer to outside material.\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "- In case your solution is found to have an overlap with solution by someone else (including external sources), all the parties involved will get zero in this and all future assignments plus further more penalties in the overall grade. We will check not just for lexical but also semantic overlap. Same applies for the code as well. Even an iota of cheating would NOT be tolerated. If you cheat one line or cheat one page the penalty would be same.\n",
    "- Be a smart agent, think long term, if you cheat we will discover it somehow, the price you would be paying is not worth it.\n",
    "- In case you are struggling with the assignment, seek help from TAs. Cheating is not an option! I respect honesty and would be lenient if you are not able to solve some questions due to difficulty in understanding. Remember we are there to help you out, seek help if something is difficult to understand.\n",
    "- The deadline for the submission is given above. Submit at least 30 minutes before the deadline, lot can happen at the last moment, your internet can fail, there can be a power failure, you can be abducted by aliens, etc.\n",
    "- You have to submit your assignment via the Google Form (link above)\n",
    "- The form would close after the deadline and we will not accept any solution. No reason what-so-ever would be accepted for not being able to submit before the deadline.\n",
    "- Since the assignment involves experimentation, reporting your results and observations, there is a lot of scope for creativity and innovation and presenting new perspectives. Such efforts would be highly appreciated and accordingly well rewarded. Be an exploratory agent!\n",
    "- Your code should be very well documented, there are marks for that.\n",
    "- In your plots, have a clear legend and clear lines, etc. Of course you would generating the plots in your code but you must also put these plots in your notebook. Generate high resolution pdf/svg version of the plots so that it doesn't pixilate on zooming.\n",
    "- For all experiments, report about the seed used in the code documentation, write about the seed used.\n",
    "- In your notebook write about all things that are not obvious from the code e.g., if you have made any assumptions, references/sources, running time, etc.\n",
    "- **DO NOT Forget to write name, roll no and email details above**\n",
    "- For each of the sub-part in the question create a new cell below the question and put your answer in there. This includes the plots as well"

For all the algorithms below, this time we will not be specifying the hyper-parameters, please play with the hyper-params to come up with the best values. This way you will learn to tune the model. Some of the values were specified in the lecture, that would be a good starting point. Your aim is to develop the best NFQ/DQN/DDQN/D3QN/D3QN-PER agent for each of the setting.  \n",

One way to overcome this is to create several different instances of the environment using different seeds and then average out the results across these and plot these. For all the plots below, you this strategy. You need to run 5 different instances of the environment for each agent. As you have seen in the lecture slides, we plot the maximum and minimum values around the mean in the plots, so this gives us the shaded plot with the mean curve in the between. In this assignment, you are required to do the same. Generate plots with envelop between maximum and minimum value (check the plotQuantity() function in the helper functions).\n",
